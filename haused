 rider. We don't play roblox anymore. Xaxa for not being able to keep cory's dick out his mouth PSA The Githubs 
 linked with the loadstrings will all be deleted so there is no trace of a link. But the script will be published on 
 a website. If you manage to find Norse V3.3. You can take ownership of it. CommanderCory gone. Not-Kyle github will

 Goodbye Ts from June 2017 to May 2022. 5 years almost 6. Norse is no longer active. Norse is deleted. No longer a 
 prison script. Sad to see a game that used to be 3,000 players now to 200 players. Only in Reg
 Prison is 3 players on weekends.
